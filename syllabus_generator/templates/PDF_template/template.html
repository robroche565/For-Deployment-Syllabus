            time of the student's enrolment. Students who came into class within 15 minutes after the start time will
            still be considered present; otherwise, the student will be marked
            as late. Seven consecutive absences may be a ground for students to be dropped in the subject. Students who
            cannot attend either face-to-face or online class due to illness

            Students are exempted from wearing their school uniforms
            during Wednesdays and Saturdays since these days are considered a wash day. Students are also required to
            wear their school ID when inside the campus, at all times.

            equipment should also be turned on and off during and after the class respectively. An additional rule for
            the laboratory is that students are required to wear their shoe

            illness (with a medical certificate) should inform the instructor
            early so they will be given a special exam before the submission of grades. Otherwise, an “INC with No
            Final/Midterm exam” will be submitted by the instructor. A calculator
            may be used depending on the content of the exam. However, mobile devices are strictly prohibited during
            major exams. Failure to do so will be considered a form of
            cheating. Major exams can be also administered online in the same manner how the online quizzes are

            of certain topics discussed, or to be discussed in the subject, and
            other concerns related to the subject. The student should set an appointment at least a day before the
